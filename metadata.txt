about=Reads attributes of your attribute table (like geometry, place name, and address) or tabular data and adds Placekeys using the Placekey API. Placekeys are unique place identifiers that can be used to join multiple datasets together. This plugin provides you with a dockwidget to query individual places on a map and a processing step to add Placekeys to multiple features of a layer at once. Get an API key at https://placekey.io/.
